# Specialization Filter Implementation for Discover Page

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented a specialization filter for the discover page that allows users to filter doctors by their medical specialization using a dropdown interface. The filter only shows main specializations (not sub-specializations) for a cleaner user experience.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. **Specialization Filter Dropdown UI**
- Added a "Specialization" dropdown button to the filter bar
- Button shows selected specialization or "Specialization" when none selected
- Uses modal-based dropdown for specialization selection (mobile-friendly)
- Clear visual feedback with active state styling
- "Clear Filter" option available in dropdown

### 2. **Main Specializations Only**
- Only shows main specializations in the dropdown (10 total)
- Excludes sub-specializations for cleaner interface
- Available specializations: General Medicine, Heart & Blood (Cardiology), Children's Health, Women's Health, Brain & Nerves, Bones & Joints, Mental Health, Skin Care, Eye Care, Ear, Nose & Throat

### 3. **Backend Integration**
- Fetches available specializations from `/doctors/specializations` endpoint
- Filters to only main specializations (not sub-specializations)
- Cached for 24 hours for performance optimization

### 4. **Filtering Logic**
- Added specialization filtering to `getFilteredAndSortedDoctors()` function
- Filters doctors by exact specialization match
- Works alongside existing online filter and search functionality
- Maintains existing sorting options

### 5. **State Management**
- Added `selectedSpecialization` state variable
- Added `availableSpecializations` state for dropdown options
- Added `loadingSpecializations` state for loading indicator
- Automatic fetching when discover tab becomes active

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (`app/patient-dashboard.tsx`)

#### 1. **New State Variables**
```tsx
const [selectedSpecialization, setSelectedSpecialization] = useState<string>('');
const [availableSpecializations, setAvailableSpecializations] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [loadingSpecializations, setLoadingSpecializations] = useState(false);
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Filtering Logic**
```tsx
const getFilteredAndSortedDoctors = () => {
  let filteredDoctors = doctors;

  // Filter by online status if toggle is enabled
  if (showOnlyOnline) {
    filteredDoctors = filteredDoctors.filter(doctor => doctor.is_online);
  }

  // Filter by specialization if selected
  if (selectedSpecialization) {
    filteredDoctors = filteredDoctors.filter(doctor => 
      doctor.specialization === selectedSpecialization
    );
  }

  // Filter by search query (name, specialization, or location)
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase().trim();
    filteredDoctors = filteredDoctors.filter(doctor => {
      const name = `${doctor.first_name || ''} ${doctor.last_name || ''}`.toLowerCase();
      const specialization = (doctor.specialization || '').toLowerCase();
      const location = (doctor.city || doctor.country || '').toLowerCase();
      
      return name.includes(query) || 
             specialization.includes(query) || 
             location.includes(query);
    });
  }

  // Sort doctors (existing logic)
  // ...
};
```

#### 3. **Main Specializations Only**
```tsx
const fetchSpecializations = async () => {
  if (loadingSpecializations) return;
  
  setLoadingSpecializations(true);
  try {
    const response = await apiService.get('/doctors/specializations');
    if (response.success && response.data) {
      // Extract only main specializations (not sub-specializations)
      const mainSpecializations: string[] = [];
      Object.keys(response.data).forEach(mainSpecialization => {
        mainSpecializations.push(mainSpecialization);
      });
      setAvailableSpecializations(mainSpecializations);
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('PatientDashboard: Error fetching specializations:', error);
  } finally {
    setLoadingSpecializations(false);
  }
};
```

#### 4. **Dropdown Component Integration**
```tsx
{/* Specialization Filter */}
<View style={{ marginRight: 12 }}>
  <SpecializationFilterDropdown
    selectedSpecialization={selectedSpecialization}
    onSpecializationChange={setSelectedSpecialization}
    availableSpecializations={availableSpecializations}
    placeholder="Specialization"
  />
</View>
```

### New Component (`components/SpecializationFilterDropdown.tsx`)

#### 1. **Dropdown Interface**
```tsx
interface SpecializationFilterDropdownProps {
    selectedSpecialization: string;
    onSpecializationChange: (specialization: string) => void;
    availableSpecializations: string[];
    placeholder?: string;
}
```

#### 2. **Modal-Based Selection**
- Clean modal interface for specialization selection
- "Clear Filter" option at the top
- Visual feedback for selected specialization
- Touch-friendly design for mobile devices

#### 3. **Styling**
- Consistent with existing filter bar design
- Active state styling when specialization is selected
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Backend Integration

#### 1. **Available Main Specializations**
The backend provides 10 main specializations:
- **General Medicine**
- **Heart & Blood (Cardiology)**
- **Children's Health**
- **Women's Health**
- **Brain & Nerves**
- **Bones & Joints**
- **Mental Health**
- **Skin Care**
- **Eye Care**
- **Ear, Nose & Throat**

#### 2. **API Endpoints**
- **GET `/doctors/specializations`**: Returns all available specializations
- **GET `/doctors/active`**: Returns doctors with specialization data for filtering
