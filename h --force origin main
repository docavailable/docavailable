[33m2a1add4[m CRITICAL FIX: Fix auto-expiration bug that was killing sessions prematurely - Fix ProcessExpiredTextSessions command to only expire sessions where patient sent message - Changed from expiring after 90s from start to expiring after 90s from doctor_response_deadline - This prevents sessions from expiring before any messages are exchanged - Added logging to track which sessions are being expired and why
[33mf6b94fd[m CRITICAL FIX: Fix session activation race condition bug - Fix session activation logic to prevent false expiration - Remove message count check that caused race conditions - Session now activates when doctor sends ANY message while waiting - Patient deadline now sets when ANY patient message is sent while waiting - Prevents sessions from incorrectly expiring when both parties send messages quickly
