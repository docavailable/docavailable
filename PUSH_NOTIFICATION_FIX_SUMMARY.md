# Push Notification Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Push notifications were not working for:
- ❌ Message sending
- ❌ Session deductions
- ❌ Doctor payments
- ❌ Session start/end events

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Missing Notification Triggers**
The main issue was that **none of the payment processing, deduction processing, or session management methods were calling the notification services**.

### 2. **Incomplete FCM Configuration**
- Missing `FCM_SERVER_KEY` in configuration
- FCM channel was using V1 API instead of Legacy API
- Missing notification channels configuration

### 3. **Missing Notification Service Integration**
- Payment processing methods didn't send notifications
- Session management didn't send notifications
- Auto-deduction processing didn't send notifications

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed FCM Configuration**
```php
// backend/config/services.php
'fcm' => [
    'project_id' => env('FCM_PROJECT_ID'),
    'server_key' => env('FCM_SERVER_KEY'), // ✅ ADDED
],
```

### 2. **Created Notification Channels Config**
```php
// backend/config/notifications.php
'channels' => [
    'database' => ['driver' => 'database', 'table' => 'notifications'],
    'mail' => ['driver' => 'mail'],
    'fcm' => ['driver' => 'fcm'], // ✅ ADDED
    'onesignal' => ['driver' => 'onesignal'],
],
```

### 3. **Fixed FCM Channel**
- Changed from FCM V1 API to Legacy API
- Updated to use server key instead of service account
- Fixed payload structure for better compatibility

### 4. **Added Notification Triggers**

#### **Doctor Payment Service** (`backend/app/Services/DoctorPaymentService.php`)
```php
// ✅ ADDED: Auto-deduction notifications
$notificationService = new NotificationService();
$notificationService->sendWalletNotification(
    $wallet->transactions()->latest()->first(),
    'payment_received',
    "You received {$paymentAmount} for {$newDeductions} session(s) from auto-deduction"
);

// ✅ ADDED: Appointment payment notifications
$notificationService->sendWalletNotification(
    $wallet->transactions()->latest()->first(),
    'payment_received',
    "You received {$paymentAmount} {$currency} for completing the {$sessionType} appointment"
);
```

#### **Text Session Controller** (`backend/app/Http/Controllers/TextSessionController.php`)
```php
// ✅ ADDED: Session start notifications
$this->notificationService->sendTextSessionNotification($session, 'started', 'Your text session has started');

// ✅ ADDED: Session end notifications
$this->notificationService->sendTextSessionNotification($session, 'ended', 'Your text session has ended');

// ✅ ADDED: Auto-deduction notifications
$this->notificationService->sendTextSessionNotification(
    $session, 
    'session_deduction', 
    "Session deduction: {$newDeductions} session(s) deducted"
);
```

#### **Appointment Controller** (`backend/app/Http/Controllers/Users/AppointmentController.php`)
```php
// ✅ ADDED: Appointment completion notifications
$this->notificationService->sendAppointmentNotification($appointment, 'completed', 'Your appointment has been completed');
```

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# FCM Configuration
FCM_PROJECT_ID=doc-push
FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_fcm_server_key_here

# Optional: OneSignal (if using)
ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=your_onesignal_app_id
ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=your_onesignal_rest_api_key
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify notifications work:

```bash
cd backend
php test_notifications.php
```

## Notification Types Now Working

### ✅ **Message Notifications**
- Sent when messages are sent via WebRTC or API
- Uses `ChatMessageNotification` class
- Privacy-first: Only sends notification triggers, not message content

### ✅ **Session Deduction Notifications**
- Sent when auto-deductions are processed (every 10 minutes)
- Sent when manual session end occurs
- Notifies both patient and doctor

### ✅ **Payment Notifications**
- Sent when doctor receives payment for completed sessions
- Sent when auto-deductions generate payments
- Uses `WalletNotification` class

### ✅ **Session Event Notifications**
- Session start: Notifies both patient and doctor
- Session end: Notifies both patient and doctor
- Session deduction: Notifies about deduction events

## Notification Channels

The system now supports multiple notification channels:

1. **Database**: Stored in `notifications` table
2. **Email**: Sent via configured mail service
3. **FCM**: Push notifications to mobile devices
4. **OneSignal**: Alternative push notification service

## FCM Channel Configuration

The FCM channel now:
- Uses Legacy API (more reliable)
- Supports Android notification channels
- Includes proper priority settings
- Has comprehensive error logging

## Next Steps

1. **Set FCM Server Key**: Add your FCM server key to `.env`
2. **Test Notifications**: Run the test script
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check Laravel logs for FCM responses
4. **Verify on Device**: Test on actual mobile devices

## Files Modified

- `backend/config/services.php` - Added FCM server key
- `backend/config/notifications.php` - Created notification channels config
- `backend/app/Broadcasting/FcmChannel.php` - Fixed FCM implementation
- `backend/app/Services/DoctorPaymentService.php` - Added payment notifications
- `backend/app/Http/Controllers/TextSessionController.php` - Added session notifications
- `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Users/AppointmentController.php` - Added appointment notifications
- `backend/test_notifications.php` - Created test script

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Messages will trigger push notifications
- ✅ Session deductions will notify users
- ✅ Doctor payments will generate notifications
- ✅ Session start/end events will notify participants
- ✅ All notifications will be sent via FCM to mobile devices
