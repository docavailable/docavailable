## Dependencies Removed

### Frontend Dependencies
- `laravel-echo` - Laravel Echo for WebSocket connections
- `pusher-js` - Pusher JavaScript client

### Backend Dependencies
- `pusher/pusher-php-server` - Pusher PHP server library

## Configuration Changes

### Frontend Configuration
- Removed `EXPO_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER` from `env.example`

### Backend Configuration
- Changed `BROADCAST_CONNECTION` from `pusher` to `log` in `backend/env`
- Removed all Pusher environment variables from `backend/env`
- Updated `backend/config/broadcasting.php` to remove Pusher configuration
- Changed default broadcaster from `pusher` to `log`

## Code Changes

### ChatController.php
- Removed all `broadcast()` calls for:
  - Message sending
  - Message reactions
  - Typing indicators

## Current State

The chat system now operates without real-time WebSocket communication. All broadcasting functionality has been removed and replaced with comments indicating that an alternative solution will be implemented.

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Alternative Real-Time Solution**
   - Consider options like:
     - Laravel WebSockets (self-hosted)
     - Socket.io with Node.js server
     - Server-Sent Events (SSE)
     - Long polling with optimized intervals
     - Firebase Realtime Database (if keeping some Firebase services)

2. **Implement New Real-Time Solution**
   - Set up the chosen technology
   - Create new event classes
   - Implement client-side connection handling
   - Update chat components to use new real-time system

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update migration guide with new real-time solution
   - Update environment variable examples
   - Update deployment instructions

4. **Test Real-Time Features**
   - Test message delivery
   - Test typing indicators
   - Test message reactions
   - Test online status updates

## Impact on Current Functionality

- **Chat messages**: Still work via polling (10-second intervals)
- **Typing indicators**: Still work via polling (2-second intervals)
- **Message reactions**: Still work via polling
- **Online status**: Still works via polling (30-second intervals)
- **Real-time updates**: Disabled - users will see updates with polling delays

## Performance Considerations

The current polling-based system will:
- Use more battery power
- Generate more server requests
- Have delayed message delivery (up to 10 seconds)
- Create higher server load

A new real-time solution should be implemented soon to restore optimal performance.
