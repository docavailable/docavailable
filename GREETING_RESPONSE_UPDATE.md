# Greeting Response Update

## Problem
The DocBot was responding to simple greetings with overly formal responses that included:
- Medical disclaimers ("I'm not a doctor")
- App feature explanations ("Discover tab", "DocAvailable")
- Appointment booking information
- Long explanations about the service

This made the bot feel robotic and unfriendly for simple greetings like "Hello" or "Hi".

## Solution
Updated the DeepSeek service to provide natural, casual greeting responses while maintaining appropriate guidance for actual health questions.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated System Prompt (`services/deepseekService.ts`)
- Added specific instruction: "For simple greetings (hello, hi, hey, how are you), respond naturally and casually like a friend would - just say hello back and ask how you can help"
- Added explicit rule: "DO NOT mention app features, DocAvailable, or booking appointments in greeting responses"
- Updated medical disclaimers to only apply to health questions
- Changed the reminder to emphasize casual greetings

#### 2. Updated Fallback Responses (`services/deepseekService.ts`)
- Replaced formal greeting responses with simple, friendly ones:
  - "Hello! ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you today?"
  - "Hi there! ðŸ˜Š What's on your mind?"
  - "Hey! ðŸ‘‹ How are you doing?"
  - "Hello! ðŸ˜Š How can I assist you?"
  - "Hi! ðŸ‘‹ What can I help you with today?"

#### 3. Updated Post-Processing Logic (`services/deepseekService.ts`)
- Added logic to skip post-processing for simple greetings
- Prevents adding app features and tips to greeting responses
- Maintains post-processing for actual health questions

### Before vs After

#### Before (Greeting Response):
```
"Hello! I'm DocBot, your health assistant for DocAvailable. I can help with general health questions and guide you to book appointments with our qualified doctors for personal concerns. How can I assist you today?"
```

#### After (Greeting Response):
```
"Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you today?"
```

### Testing Results
