# Pricing Information Update

## Problem
The DocBot was providing incorrect information about pricing, suggesting that:
- Users would find different prices for doctors in the Discover page
- Doctors charge individual consultation fees
- Users need to pay per consultation

This was inaccurate because DocAvailable uses a subscription-based model, not per-consultation fees.

## Solution
Updated the DeepSeek service with accurate pricing information and app functionality details.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated System Prompt (`services/deepseekService.ts`)
Added comprehensive pricing and app functionality information:

**Pricing Structure:**
- DocAvailable uses a subscription-based model, NOT per-consultation fees
- Users pay a monthly subscription fee to access unlimited consultations with doctors
- Subscription plans vary by location and include:
  - Basic Life: 100 MWK (Malawi) / 20 USD (other countries) - 30 days, 3 text sessions, 1 voice call
  - Executive Life: 150 MWK (Malawi) / 50 USD (other countries) - 30 days, 10 text sessions, 2 voice calls, 1 video call
  - Premium Life: 200 MWK (Malawi) / 200 USD (other countries) - 30 days, 50 text sessions, 15 voice calls, 5 video calls
- Doctors do NOT charge individual consultation fees - all consultations are included in the subscription
- Pricing is location-based (Malawi uses MWK, other countries use USD)
- Users can view and purchase plans in the "Dashboard" tab

**How It Works:**
- Users subscribe to a plan to access the platform
- Once subscribed, they can book unlimited consultations with any available doctor
- Consultations include text chat, voice calls, and video calls (depending on plan)
- No additional fees per consultation - everything is included in the subscription
- Users can upgrade or downgrade their plan at any time

#### 2. Updated Response Guidelines
- Added guideline: "When users ask about pricing, explain the subscription model clearly"
- Updated app integration section to reference subscription-based payment system
- Added instruction to guide users to "Dashboard" tab for plan options

#### 3. Updated Post-Processing Logic (`services/deepseekService.ts`)
Enhanced pricing question detection and response:
- Expanded keywords to include: 'payment', 'cost', 'price', 'fee'
- Updated response to explain subscription model clearly
- Added specific pricing information (100 MWK / 20 USD starting prices)
- Emphasized that consultations are included in subscription

### Before vs After

#### Before (Pricing Response):
```
"Users will find different prices for doctors in the Discover page. Each doctor sets their own consultation fees."
```

#### After (Pricing Response):
```
"DocAvailable uses a subscription model. Once you subscribe to a plan, all consultations are included - no additional fees per consultation. Check the 'Dashboard' tab to view our affordable plans starting from 100 MWK (Malawi) or 20 USD (other countries)."
```
