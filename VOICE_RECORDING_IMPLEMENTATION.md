# Voice Recording Implementation

## Overview
Voice recording functionality has been successfully implemented in the chat system. Users can now record and send voice messages in real-time conversations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Voice Recording Service (`services/voiceRecordingService.ts`)
- **Audio Recording**: Uses `expo-av` for high-quality audio recording
- **Permission Handling**: Automatically requests microphone permissions
- **File Upload**: Uploads recorded audio to the server
- **Duration Tracking**: Tracks recording duration in real-time
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all recording operations

### 2. Voice Message Player (`components/VoiceMessagePlayer.tsx`)
- **Audio Playback**: Plays voice messages with progress tracking
- **Visual Controls**: Play/pause button with progress bar
- **Duration Display**: Shows current position and total duration
- **Loading States**: Handles loading and error states gracefully

### 3. Chat Integration (`app/chat/[appointmentId].tsx`)
- **Recording Interface**: Shows recording state with duration and controls
- **Voice Button**: Microphone button that changes to stop button when recording
- **Preview Interface**: Shows recorded message with send/cancel options
- **Message Display**: Voice messages are displayed with the player component

## User Interface Flow

### Recording Process
1. **Start Recording**: User taps the microphone button
   - Button changes to red stop button
   - Recording interface appears showing duration
   - Red recording indicator appears

2. **During Recording**: 
   - Duration timer updates in real-time
   - Stop button to end recording
   - Cancel button to discard recording

3. **After Recording**:
   - Preview interface shows "Voice message ready"
   - Send button to upload and send the message
   - Cancel button to discard the recording

### Message Display
- Voice messages appear with a play button and progress bar
- Duration is displayed in MM:SS format
- Progress bar shows playback position
- Messages maintain the same styling as text messages

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Support
- **Upload Endpoint**: `/api/upload/voice-message` handles file uploads
- **Message Storage**: Voice messages are stored with `message_type: 'voice'`
- **File Storage**: Audio files are stored in `chat_voice_messages/` directory
- **Audio Streaming**: Custom endpoint serves audio files with proper headers

### Frontend Integration
- **Message Storage Service**: Updated to handle voice messages
- **Real-time Updates**: Voice messages sync with existing chat system
- **Delivery Status**: Voice messages follow same delivery status flow as text messages

## File Structure
```
services/
├── voiceRecordingService.ts    # Voice recording logic
└── messageStorageService.ts    # Updated for voice messages

components/
└── VoiceMessagePlayer.tsx      # Voice message playback

└── [appointmentId].tsx        # Updated chat interface
```

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/upload/voice-message` - Upload voice message file

## Permissions Required
